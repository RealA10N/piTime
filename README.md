## Translate

One of the best ways to support my project is by translating it to your local language! It takes only about 20 minutes, and it helps to spread the project a ton. So, you are in? Great! here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. Open the [i18n](/i18n) folder. This folder is the folder containing all the translation files of the project!

3. If your language isn't listed in the [languages.json](/i18n/languages.json) file, add it! Please use the [language code standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), and add the language name and the language direction ("ltr" for left-to-right, "rtl" for right-to-left).

4. Open the json file that corresponds to your local language ([en.json](i18n/en.json) for example). If this file doesn't exist, copy [en.json](i18n/en.json), change his name and start translating!

### Important comments

-   Please make sure **not** to translate "piTime" to your language (leave it in English!)
-   The base language of the site is English. Please only use [en.json](i18n/en.json) as your source!
